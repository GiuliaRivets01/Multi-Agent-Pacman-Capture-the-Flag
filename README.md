# Multi-Agent-Pacman-Capture-the-Flag
This is the second assignment of the course *Modern Games AI Algorithms*.

In this assignment we have implemented two algorihtms, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and A* search algorithm, in order to participate in the *Pacman Capture the Flag Challenge.*

The MCTS agent is implemented in *MCTS.py*, while the agent developed by using the A* search algoirithm can be found in the file *heuristic.py*.
